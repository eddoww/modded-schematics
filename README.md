# Modded Schematics

Schematic files for modded Minecraft 1.12.2 that can be used with
[Schemetica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica) and
[WorldEdit](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/worldedit).

## Installing

#### Schematica

Schematica requires [LunatriusCore](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/lunatriuscore) as a
dependency.

Schematics looks for schematics in `schematics` in the Minecraft directory.

**Configuration (Optional)**

Schematica can be configured to be more powerful in `config/schematica.cfg` in the Minecraft
directory.

You can fiddle with the options at `.minecraft/config/schematica.cfg`. The lines of interest are:

	B:placeAdjacent=false

and

	B:placeInstantly=true


Alternatively, you can check out our configuration
[here](https://github.com/eddoww/modded-schematics/releases/download/v1.2/schematica.cfg).

## Replacing Blocks

If you are using Schematica, there is a way to replace blocks of a specific type in the
projected schematic. For example, if you would like to replace the dirt in the Water Wheel, you can
use the following command:

	/schematica replace dirt grass
