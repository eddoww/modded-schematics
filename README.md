# Modded Schematics
Schematic files for Modded Minecraft. These can be used with worldedit, or Schematica mod if you please. Most are created for the more recent 1.12 modpacks, but they may or may not work on older modpacks as well.



## Usage
You can use these schematics in conjunction with [Schemetica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica/files) or [Worldedit](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/worldedit).
